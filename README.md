# Air Water Quality Index and Environmental Monitoring 

### Overview

The Air and Water Quality Monitoring System is a web-based platform for visualizing real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) and Water Quality Index (WQI) data. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it offers an interactive, user-friendly interface to display environmental data, explore trends, and search by location. The gh-pages branch hosts the static frontend, deployed via GitHub Pages at https://thrishankkuntimaddi.github.io/Air-Water-Quality-Index-and-Environmental-Monitoring/.

### Features:
-> Real-Time Data Display: Shows AQI and WQI metrics fetched from APIs or mock data.
-> Interactive Visualizations: Renders charts for air (e.g., PM2.5, CO) and water (e.g., pH, turbidity) parameters.
-> Responsive Design: Adapts to desktops, tablets, and mobiles.
-> Location-Based Search: Enables users to view data for specific areas.
-> User-Friendly Interface: Simplifies navigation and data exploration.
